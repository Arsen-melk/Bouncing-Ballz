# Bouncing Ballz

## Overview
The Bouncing Ballz project is a simple interactive web application where users can create bouncing balls by clicking on the canvas. The balls will bounce with realistic physics and play a sound when they hit the ground. 

## Files
`index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the webpage.
`style.css`: The CSS file for styling the webpage.
`script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for the bouncing balls.
`bounce.mp3`: The audio file that plays when the balls bounce.

## Usage
This is a very simple project and to run this project, you need to ensure all the files are in the same directory. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the interactive canvas.

## Features
.Click on the canvas to create a new ball at the clicked position.
.Press the spacebar to spawn a ball at a random horizontal position at the top of the canvas.
.Balls bounce with gravity and friction applied, creating a realistic effect.

## Effects
.Balls bounce with gravity and friction applied, creating a realistic effect.

.A maximum of 15 balls can be displayed at once; adding more will reset the balls.

## Dependencies
